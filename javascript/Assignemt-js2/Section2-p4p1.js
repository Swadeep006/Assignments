/*
In JavaScript:

-> If fewer arguments are passed than defined parameters, the missing ones are assigned undefined.
-> If more arguments are passed than there are parameters, the extra values are ignored unless a rest parameter is used to capture them.
-> JavaScript functions are flexible in arityâ€”they don't throw an error due to mismatched argument counts.
